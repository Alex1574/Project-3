1. It tackled real world topics in a effective way that did not seem to ridicule the people of the world, som much as to inform.
2. The use of CGI was so effective that the characters present in movie who were made of the images seemed to be other worldly.
3. The actors present in the movie conveyed the emotions of many that would be expected so much so that it did not appear as if they were acting.
