    </ul>
    1. Through the use of random sound, whenever the wife says her name some sound plays so that the audience never figures out her name.
    2. The use of many cinematic tools that Tarentino movies commonly use, show the importance of every scene because there is a deeper meaning behind even the scenes that many view as pointless.
    3. This is the first movie that Tarnetino directed thart had violence that was actually shown on the screen because the importance of the violence to the progression of the plot of the story

    <h1> 2.Avatar</h1>
    <ul></ul>  - [Avatar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/) is the story of humans finding a land that is home to an alien race. This land has a metal substance present in the world that the humans wanted. This led to warbetween the humans and the alien and one of the humans uses a clone of an alien joined the side of the alien to fight for their freedom.
    <strong>Reasons I like Avatar</strong>
    1. It tackled real world topics in a effective way that did not seem to ridicule the people of the world, som much as to inform.
    2. The use of CGI was so effective that the characters present in movie who were made of the images seemed to be other worldly.
    3. The actors present in the movie conveyed the emotions of many that would be expected so much so that it did not appear as if they were acting.
    > "No. No. To get even? Even-Steven? I would have to kill you, go up to Nikki's room, kill her, then wait for your husband, the good Doctor Bell, to come home and kill him. That would be even, Verntia. That'd be about square."
    <h1>1. The Goonies</h1> 
    ![Image of the Goonies Banner](./Goonies.jpg)
    <ul></ul> - [The Goonies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089218/) is a movie about a group of misfit kids who are about to lose tyheir homes due to forclosure if they do not pay a certain amount of money by the end of the day.

After searching around they run into a group of criminals looking for the treasure too and the drama of the movie starts. This results in the group who call themselves the Goonies to run into many weird and unquie situations.
    <strong>Reasons why I like the Goonies</strong>
    1. The main characters of the movie are a froup of outcast kids that are not that popular or special, but by working together accomplish things that even the smartest of adults couldn't.
    2. Uses a mix of comedy and drama to create scences that are both suppensful and full of comedy.
    3. The antaginist of the movies are not the most inteligent of people, but they are still an imposing threat in the world to the children.
