    2. The use of CGI was so effective that the characters present in movie who were made of the images seemed to be other worldly.</li>
    3. The actors present in the movie conveyed the emotions of many that would be expected so much so that it did not appear as if they were acting.</li>
    > "No. No. To get even? Even-Steven? I would have to kill you, go up to Nikki's room, kill her, then wait for your husband, the good Doctor Bell, to come home and kill him. That would be even, Verntia. That'd be about square."
